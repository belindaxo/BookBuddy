# Virtual Wardrobe Assistant

**What will the application do?**

The Virtual Wardrobe Assistant is a Java application designed to allow users to digitally catalog their wardrobes, 
having each user specify attributes such as color, style, and fabric for each item. Through the utilization of color 
theory and general style rules, the Virtual Wardrobe Assistant will suggest outfits appropriate any occasion and 
taking into account the user's personal preferences. The application offers the additional feature of weather-based 
outfit suggestions, where the user can input the days' weather conditions to receive suitable recommendations. 
Additionally, the Virtual Wardrobe Assistant includes an Outfit Diary feature where users can save and view their 
favourite outfits. The application also provides insights on the user's wardrobe usage, such as most and least-worn 
items, as well as allowing users to create custom tags and categories that can be used to further personalize the app.

**Who will use it?**

This application is particularly beneficial for those who struggle with the daily challenge of deciding what to wear.
It also serves as a great tool for fashion enthusiasts to keep track of their best outfits and continue creating fun, 
new looks from the items already found in their closet. For the eco-conscious user, the Virtual Wardrobe Assistant's 
wardrobe organization and usage insights will prove useful for environmentally-friendly practices such as donating items
that aren't frequently worn and offering fresh, new looks using the user's existing wardrobe to avoid unnecessary 
purchases that contribute to the range of negative environmental impacts that the fashion industry is responsible for.

**Why did I create this project?**

I got the idea for this project while brainstorming options for a personal project. I wanted to develop something that 
was unique and creative as well as something that both myself and others would use and benefit from. While thinking of 
ways I could incorporate my interests into a Java application, I remembered the iconic scene from the 
90's movie *Clueless*, [where the protagonist, Cher, picks out her outfit of the day using a 
custom wardrobe program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU&ab_channel=KeriKelly). As someone with ADHD who 
struggles to figure out what to wear in enough time to not be late, having an app that can provide outfit options would
be a huge time saver and anxiety-reliever. I also often find that both myself and my two roommates always have the 
feeling that we "don't have anything to wear", despite having a closet full of clothes. This often leads to spending
more money on new clothes that we don't really need, and as the cycle repeats, a lot of the items we own are 
rarely worn, collecting dust on the clothes rack. Thus, I knew that I wanted to develop an application with
tools that: catalog a personal wardrobe, offer insights on the usage of items, give well-tuned and personalized outfit
suggestions, save the best looks for future use, and lastly, provide inspiration for new outfit ideas for fellow 
fashion-lovers like myself.
