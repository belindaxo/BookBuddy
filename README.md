# BookBuddy: a Comprehensive Reading Management Tool

## What will the application do?

**BookBuddy** is an interactive Java application designed for book enthusiasts. This application helps users organize 
their book collections, record their reading experiences, receive personalized book recommendations, and track their 
reading habits and goals. 

### Key features:

**Virtual Bookshelf** - Allows users to organize and manage their personal book collections digitally. Users can add 
books, categorize them, and mark them as read, unread, or in-progress with additional details like author, genre,
length, and more.

**Interactive Reading Journal** - Offers a space for users to write notes, thoughts, and capture favorite quotes for 
each book in their collection. This feature encourages reflective reading and serves as useful log of the user's 
reading experiences.

**Book Recommendation System** - Using a series of user-inputted preferences (such as genre, complexity, and length), 
they will receive suggestions for their next read from their collection.

**Reading Habit & Goal Tracker** - Helps users track their daily reading progress (in terms of pages or books) and set 
specific reading goals. Daily reading streaks will be tracked to motivate consistent reading habits and completion of
personalized goals. This feature will be updated in the future to include visual data representations to illustrate 
the user's progress over time.

Users will start by adding books to their virtual bookshelf. From there, they can create journal entries for each book
that document their reading experiences and encourage reflective reading habits. The reading tracker feature will 
allow for users to log their daily reading activities and set personal reading goals they hope to reach. The 
recommendation feature suggests books from the user's collection based on their preferences for their next read.

## Who will use it?

BookBuddy is designed for avid readers and lovers of literature who want to organize their reading in a digital space.
It is particularly appealing for those who, like myself, have a bad habit of buying new books more frequently than they
end up actually reading, resulting in a large collection of books waiting to be read. This application is also great for 
individuals wanting to track their reading habits and goals and reflect on their reading experiences, members of book
clubs who want to organize their reading lists and prepare notes for discussions, students needing to organize and 
keep track of their assigned readings, and lastly, anyone who is looking to introduce or improve the habit of reading 
into their lives.

## Why did I create this project?

As someone who enjoys reading, the idea of creating an application centered on enhancing the reading experience is both
exciting and personally useful. As a person with ADHD, I struggle with completing books, reading consistently, and 
buying books that end up collecting dust on my shelves as I promise myself "I'll get to them eventually." This has been
particularly frustrating for me, as I truly am very passionate about literature and love to read, I just need a way to
make the habit of reading more structured and goal-oriented. By being able to set goals for how much I would like to
read daily and how many books I would like to finish in a year, I am better able to introduce an effective, consistent
reading habit in my life. Additionally, I often find myself passively reading and forgetting any thoughts or experiences
I had while reading, and by having an interface that includes the ability to jot down any ideas or memorable quotes as
I read would be very beneficial. Aside from the personal benefit I would receive from using such an application, 
developing this project would serve as a challenging opportunity to utilize my skills in software development, UX/UI 
design, and data science.
